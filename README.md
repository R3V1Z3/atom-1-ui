# Atom 1.0 UI

Meager attempt at replicating the aesthetics of the infamous [Atom 1.0 home computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk) through the Atom editor software it inspired. Or maybe it was the other way around. No one knows.

This relatively simple fork of Atom One Dark UI just adds some much-needed 70s. Atom One was too modern and far too fast. This adds vintage 70s to slow it right down.
