# Atom 1.0 UI

Meager attempt at replicating the aesthetics of the infamous [Atom 1.0 home computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk) through the Atom editor software it inspired. Or maybe it was the other way around. Who knows.

This relatively simple fork of Atom One Dark UI just adds some much-needed 70s. Atom One was too modern and far too fast. This adds vintage 70s to slow it right down.

> Markdown with Atom One Light syntax. It works with light themes, it's just real bright.

## Animations

70s color effects can be enabled in the theme settings with the `Enable animations` option. Please note, animation effects are very heavy so they slow things down real good and can eat your CPU.
